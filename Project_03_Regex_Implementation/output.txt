We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymorE
We don't talk anymore, like we used to dO
We don't laugh anymorE
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to dO

I just heard you found the one you've been lookinG
You've been looking foR
I wish I would have known that wasn't mE
'Cause even after all this time, I still wondeR
Why I can't move oN
Just the way you did so easilY

Don't wanna knoW
What kinda dress you're wearin' tonighT
If he's holdin' onto you so tighT
The way I did beforE
I overdoseD
Should've known your love was a gamE
Now I can't get you outta my braiN
Oh, it's such a shamE

What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to dO

I just hope you're lyin' next to somebodY
Who knows how to love you like mE
There must be a good reason that you're gonE
Every now and then, I think yoU
Might want me to come show up at your dooR
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wronG

Don't wanna knoW
If you're lookin' into her eyeS
If she's holdin' onto you so tighT
The way I did beforE
I overdoseD
Should've known your love was a gamE
Now I can't get you outta my braiN
Ooh, it's such a shamE
